// ── Toolset ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

export const descToolsetChaos = `Harness Resilience Testing (Formerly known as Chaos Engineering) — controlled failure injection against Kubernetes/Linux workloads to measure and improve resilience.
IMPORTANT: If user refers to Chaos or Resilience Testing both are same, but use Resilience Testing in your responses for all kind of Chaos related questions & tools usage.

PRIMITIVES (the building blocks of every experiment):
- Fault — a single failure injection step (e.g. pod-delete, gcp-vm-kill, disk-fill, network-loss). Built-in or custom; lives in a chaos hub. Resource: chaos_fault.
- Action — a non-failure step used for setup/teardown (delay, customScript, container exec). Resource: chaos_action.
- Probe — a continuous health check that runs alongside the experiment (httpProbe, cmdProbe, promProbe, k8sProbe, sloProbe, datadogProbe, etc.). Probe verdicts produce the resiliency score. Resource: chaos_probe.
- Experiment — a manifest combining one or more faults + actions + probes, plus runtime variables. Resource: chaos_experiment. Supports run/stop. The same primitives have template forms (chaos_fault_template, chaos_action_template, chaos_probe_template, chaos_experiment_template) that live in chaos hubs (chaos_hub) and are instantiated via the create_from_template execute action.

INFRASTRUCTURE LAYER (where experiments execute):
- chaos_k8s_infrastructure — a chaos agent installed inside a Kubernetes cluster, scoped to one Harness environment. An experiment can only run when status=ACTIVE and isChaosEnabled=true.
- chaos_infrastructure — Linux/machine equivalent.
- chaos_environment — the Harness env scoping the infra.

SERVICE DISCOVERY (SD) — END-TO-END JOURNEY:
1. Customer installs an SD agent in a Kubernetes cluster (one agent per chaos_k8s_infrastructure).
2. SD agent uses eBPF to discover namespaces, services, workloads, and inter-service connections. Inspect via discovered_namespace, discovered_service.
3. Customer (or rules) selects a subset of services into an SD network map. Inspect via discovered_network_map (raw, per-agent inventory).
4. The SD network map is promoted into a chaos_application_map, scoped to one (environment, infrastructure) pair.
5. Experiments bound to that application map automatically tag themselves with workload=<name> AND service=<name> for each workload/service in the manifest — enabling blast-radius reporting and the workload=/service= filters (see system tags below).

SYSTEM TAGS auto-emitted by the backend on chaos_experiment create/update — use these as the primary filter for "find experiments that target X":
- fault=<faultName>       (ALWAYS attached, one per fault step) — tags=fault=pod-delete; tags=fault=gcp matches all gcp-* faults (substring).
- probe=<probeID>         (ALWAYS attached, one per probe reference) — tags=probe=<probeID>.
- workload=<workloadName> (ONLY when bound to chaos_application_map) — from manifest Targets.Selectors.Workloads. tags=workload=payments-api.
- service=<serviceName>   (ONLY when bound to chaos_application_map) — from the manifest's resolved service mapping. tags=service=payments-api.
Filter is AND substring match across the experiment's tag array. Combine: tags=fault=pod-delete,workload=payments-api.
Note: "workload" = Kubernetes Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet (NOT a Pod). Chaos faults always target workloads; pods are ephemeral.

COMMON GOTCHAS:
- chaos_experiment list filters infra_id and environment_id are silently ignored when passed alone — backend requires BOTH together.
- chaos_experiment list filters infra_name, infra_active, status are PARSED but NEVER applied by the backend aggregation. Don't pass them — agents would think they work and silently get unfiltered results. Use infra_id (paired with environment_id) for infra filtering.
- chaos_application_map get treats environment_id + infra_id as de facto required: the backend's Mongo lookup is keyed on {identity, infra_id, environment_ref}, so missing either returns HTTP 500 with "mongo: no documents in result" (no validation error).
- SD endpoints (discovered_*) require an agent_identity that is also a registered chaos_k8s_infrastructure.identity.
- Chaos REST API uses organizationIdentifier (not orgIdentifier) — the registry handles this via scopeParams override; agents shouldn't notice.

REASONING PLAYBOOK — answering "list experiments for <high-level X>" (e.g. "Harness Payment Bank", "the payments service"):
X is rarely a chaos_experiment field directly. It's almost always a Harness project, a K8s service name, a workload name, or an application-map name. Resolve it before listing:

  Step 1. Identify scope. If the user names a project/org → set project_id/org_id. If they name an environment ("prod") → list chaos_environment with search_term=<env keyword>. If they name a cluster → list chaos_k8s_infrastructure. Remember: env_id + infra_id must be passed TOGETHER on chaos_experiment list — either alone is silently dropped.

  Step 2. Resolve X to concrete tag values. Two sub-paths:
    (2a) Fast path — try tag-substring directly: chaos_experiment list with tags=workload=<keyword> (e.g. tags=workload=payment). The backend's substring match is forgiving. If the result count looks right, you're done.
    (2b) Discovery path — when X is fuzzy or you need to enumerate workloads first:
      (i)   chaos_application_map list filtered by env+infra → pick the map(s) matching X by name.
      (ii)  chaos_application_map get on each candidate → response.services[].name gives service names; response.<resources>[].name gives workload names; response.identity is the app-map ID.
      (iii) chaos_experiment list with target_network_map_ids=<map identity> (returns ALL experiments on that map; no tag filter needed) OR tags=service=<name>,workload=<name> for narrower hits.

  Step 3. If the customer wants raw inventory (not chaos-augmented), use discovered_network_map list with agent_identity=<infra identity> + environment_id; then discovered_service for finer detail. Use this when the user asks "what services even exist in my cluster" before they pick targets.

  Step 4. NEVER pass infra_name, infra_active, or status to chaos_experiment list — backend silently drops them. Use infra_id (paired with environment_id) instead.

Common compound queries:
  - "experiments touching payments in prod"     → env+infra together → tags=workload=payment
  - "experiments running today on app map M"    → target_network_map_ids=M, start_date=today
  - "my experiments, no automation noise"       → my_experiments=true, exclude_automation=true
  - "every pod-delete experiment account-wide"  → tags=fault=pod-delete (no env/infra needed)
  - "experiments using HTTP probe X"            → tags=probe=X`;

export const descChaosExperiment = `Chaos experiment definition — a saved, manifest-backed test that injects one or more faults against selected workloads.
Supports list, get, delete, create, and execute actions: run, stop. Use chaos_experiment_variable list to discover required runtime inputs before running.

System tags (auto-emitted by the backend on create/update — use these as the primary filter for "experiments that target X"):
- fault=<faultName> — ALWAYS attached, one per fault step in the manifest (e.g. fault=pod-delete, fault=gcp-vm-kill). Use tags=fault=<name> to find every experiment that runs a given fault. Substring matches, so tags=fault=gcp matches all gcp-* faults.
- probe=<probeID> — ALWAYS attached, one per probe reference in the manifest. Use tags=probe=<probeID> to find every experiment using a specific health-check probe.
- workload=<workloadName> — attached ONLY when the experiment is bound to a chaos_application_map (targetNetworkMapID is set on the experiment). Sourced from manifest Targets.Selectors.Workloads[].Names (V1) or TARGET_WORKLOAD_NAMES env (V2 enterprise faults). Use tags=workload=<name> to find every experiment that targets a specific Kubernetes workload (Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet — NOT a Pod).
- service=<serviceName> — attached ALONGSIDE workload= ONLY when bound to a chaos_application_map. Sourced from the manifest's resolved service mapping. Use tags=service=<name> to find experiments targeting a specific Kubernetes Service (label-selector → pods).

Filter semantics: the tags filter is an AND substring match across the experiment's tag array. Pass multiple tags via comma-separated value (e.g. tags=fault=pod-delete,workload=payments-api).

TWO WAYS to find experiments targeting a workload/service X:
  (a) Tag filter — list with tags=workload=X (or tags=service=X). Works without knowing which app map X belongs to. Substring, so tags=workload=payment matches all payment-* workloads.
  (b) App-map filter — list with target_network_map_ids=<map identity>. Use when you already know the app map; returns ALL experiments bound to it regardless of which workload they target.
Approach (a) is broader (any tagged workload, no app-map needed); (b) is narrower (only experiments bound to a specific map).

This is a GUIDED, ORDERED workflow — do NOT skip ahead or invent identifiers; each step depends on the selection made in the previous one. Do NOT advance to the next step until the current step's selection is made, and NEVER call harness_create(chaos_service) until every step below is resolved and the user has confirmed.

STEP 1 — Select a Discovery Agent (REQUIRED FIRST; gate: do not continue without a chosen agent).
  Call harness_list(resource_type='discovered_agent', org_id, project_id). Show each agent's name, identity, serviceCount, and installationType. Ask the user to pick one.
  From the chosen agent capture: agent_id = agent.identity; environment_id = agent.environmentIdentifier. For SD Kubernetes agents set infrastructure_id = agent.identity (BARE, not env-prefixed) and infrastructure_type = "KubernetesV2".

STEP 2 — Select the Service to onboard (REQUIRED, only after STEP 1; gate: do not continue without a chosen service).
  2a. (Optional namespace narrowing) harness_list(resource_type='discovered_namespace', agent_identity=<agent.identity>, environment_id=<environment_id>, all=true). Ask the user to pick a namespace, or skip to list all services.
  2b. harness_list(resource_type='discovered_service', agent_identity=<agent.identity>, environment_id=<environment_id>, compact=false[, namespace=<picked namespace>]). For each service show: name; namespace = spec.kubernetes.namespace; IP = spec.kubernetes.service.clusterIP (fallback spec.ip[0]); port = spec.kubernetes.service.ports[0].port (fallback spec.port[0]). Ask the user to pick a service.
  Capture external_service_id = <selected discovered service>.id.

STEP 3 — Configure Metadata (REQUIRED, only after STEP 2).
  Ask the user for name (REQUIRED), description (optional), and tags (optional). Derive identity as a slug of name unless the user supplies one. identity must be unique in scope — create fails on a duplicate identity or a duplicate external_service_id.

STEP 4 — Associate Probes (REQUIRED DECISION, only after STEP 3).
  Explicitly ask the user: attach one or more health-check probes now, or create the service with no probes? Do not assume.
  - If none: probes = [].
  - If attaching: harness_list(resource_type='chaos_probe', infra_type='KubernetesV2'[, entity_type='httpProbe'|'cmdProbe'|'datadogProbe'|... to filter by probe type]). For EACH probe the user selects, read its inputs[] array (from the list item, or harness_get chaos_probe). For every input, prompt the user for a value — MANDATORY when required=true — and REPLACE the placeholder value "<+input>" with the user's value while keeping the rest of the input object (name, path, category, type, reference, ...) unchanged. Build probes = [{ probeId: <probe.identity>, inputs: [<full input objects with the user's values>] }, ...].

STEP 5 — Create. Only now call harness_create(resource_type='chaos_service', org_id, project_id, body={ identity, name, description?, tags?, external_service_id, agent_id, environment_id, infrastructure_id, infrastructure_type, probes }). The server re-resolves serviceType and namespace from external_service_id and stores infrastructureId as "<environment_id>/<infrastructure_id>". Returns the full ChaosServiceResponse on 200.

export const descChaosServiceAgentId = `Service Discovery agent identity (maps to agentId). Required. Use the 'identity' field of the agent chosen from discovered_agent list (STEP 1 of create). The agent's environmentIdentifier becomes environment_id, and for SD Kubernetes agents its identity is also the bare infrastructure_id.`;
export const descChaosServiceEnvironmentId = `Harness environment identifier the service lives in (maps to environmentId). Required.`;

To preserve the current description/tags, fetch the service first (harness_get) and re-supply its current values. Probes is a REQUIRED desired-state array: it is reconciled atomically with the field update, and any probe present on the service but not in the array is removed. To keep the current probes, harness_get first and resupply the 'probes' array unchanged; pass [] to intentionally detach every probe. Returns the full ChaosServiceResponse on 200.`;

Optional (schema-wise): description, tags — but "optional" only means the request validates without them. Omitting description or tags CLEARS them server-side (full replace, no partial patch); re-supply the current value from a prior harness_get if you want it preserved. probes is required precisely because it is a full replace: supply the complete desired set (harness_get first to keep existing ones), or [] to detach all probes.

Locust is supported on Linux VM and Kubernetes (script + image modes). K6 is genuinely Kubernetes-only at the backend. JMeter is restricted to Kubernetes by MCP for parity with the Harness UI (the backend itself does not enforce this for JMeter) — Linux VM supports Locust only; MCP rejects K6/JMeter with a Linux target_type at create time. JMeter accepts script/script_image scalars like Locust/K6 (plus properties/env_vars/thresholds/worker_count); 'tool_config' remains available as an advanced escape hatch (e.g. .zip bundles).
To create one, follow the prerequisite chain declared in relatedResources: (1) pick a load-runner infra via chaos_infrastructure (Linux VM) or chaos_enabled_infrastructure (Kubernetes), then (2) list chaos_service with infrastructure_ids='<environment_id>/<infra_id>' and pick one — or create a chaos_service if the list is empty — feeding its identity into service_references. When picking a Kubernetes infra, remember to set target_type='kubernetes' explicitly; it is not derived from the infra you chose.

End-to-end lifecycle (an LLM should reason about this when answering "how do I run a chaos experiment against my services?"):
  1. Customer installs a Service Discovery (SD) agent into a Kubernetes cluster (one agent per chaos_k8s_infrastructure).
  2. SD agent uses eBPF to discover namespaces, services, workloads (Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet — NOT pods), and inter-service connections. List these via discovered_namespace and discovered_service.
  3. Customer (or an automated rule) selects a subset of discovered services + connections into an SD network map. Inspect via discovered_network_map.
  4. The SD network map is "promoted" into a chaos application map (this resource), tied to one (environment, infrastructure). One application map per (env, infra, identity).

IMPORTANT: You MUST NOT auto-fill, assume, or pre-pick any value on behalf of the user.
At every step below, you MUST display the relevant options and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
NOTE: based on previous user activity still don't assume their org/project/infra/probe-type/values — they may want different choices every time.

ENUM FIELDS — use multi-option elicitation (NOT open-text prompts). When a field has a fixed set of valid values, present them as discrete clickable options (radio / button list / multi-choice) so the user picks rather than types. Apply this to:
  - infrastructure_type → Kubernetes | Linux | Windows
  - type (filtered per Step 1 matrix for the chosen infra)
  - operation (k8sProbe) → create | delete | present | absent
  - comparator.type → int | float | string
  - auth.type → Basic | Bearer (or "no auth" as a third choice)
  - method (httpProbe) → GET | POST
  - HTTP body source (POST) → body (inline) | bodyPath (file)
  - assertion target (httpProbe) → responseCode | responseBody
  - verbosity → info | debug
  - boolean fields (is_enabled, stopOnFailure, insecureSkipVerify, source.inheritInputs, source.hostNetwork, source.privileged, variable.required, etc.) → true | false
Free-text input is fine for naturally open fields (probe_id, name, URL, command, query, comparator.value, description, tags, etc.).

Required workflow — follow in order, pausing for user input after EACH step. Do NOT proceed to the next step until the current step is fully answered by the user:

Step 1 — Choose infrastructure_type, then probe type (REJECT invalid combinations):
  Ask the user to pick infrastructure_type from: Kubernetes | Linux | Windows.
  Then ask which probe type to create, restricted to the matrix below for the chosen infra:
    Kubernetes → httpProbe | cmdProbe | promProbe | k8sProbe | datadogProbe | dynatraceProbe | apmProbe | containerProbe
    Linux     → httpProbe | cmdProbe | datadogProbe | dynatraceProbe
    Windows   → httpProbe | cmdProbe
  These are the ONLY valid (infra, type) pairings — any other pairing must be rejected ("not supported on this infrastructure_type").
  Do NOT proceed until both infrastructure_type AND type are explicitly chosen by the user.

Step 2 — Collect identity:
  Ask the user for probe_id (slug, must match [a-z0-9-]+, unique within the project), name (only default to probe_id if the user explicitly accepts), description (optional — ask explicitly, don't skip silently), tags (optional, "key:value" pairs — ask explicitly).
  Do NOT generate or assume any of these.
  Strictly follow the order of steps and don't skip any step. Now move to Step 3.

Step 3 — Collect variables (optional):
  Ask the user whether they want to define probe-level variables. Do NOT skip this question.
  If yes: for each variable ask name, type (String | Number), value (literal, or "<+input>" for runtime), required (true/false), description (optional).
  If no: set variables: [].
  Strictly follow the order of steps and don't skip any step. Now move to Step 4.

Step 4 — Collect probeProperties (type-specific — ask each field one turn at a time):
  - httpProbe: URL, HTTP method (GET|POST), criteria operator + target (responseCode XOR responseBody), auth (Basic|Bearer, or omit for none), TLS (caFile/certFile/keyFile/insecureSkipVerify), headers (key/value pairs). If method=POST also: contentType (e.g. "application/json") + payload via body (inline) XOR bodyPath (file path).
  - cmdProbe: command (shell command), comparator (type=int|float|string + criteria + value), execution mode (inline = omit source; source pod = build spec object with image required + optional command/args/env/inheritInputs/hostNetwork/privileged/imagePullPolicy/imagePullSecrets/nodeSelector/tolerations/volumes/volumeMount/labels/annotations, then JSON.stringify it — source is a JSON-encoded STRING on the wire, NOT a JSON object), env vars (top-level cmdProbe.env for inline mode; inside source.env using corev1.EnvVar shape for source mode — top-level cmdProbe.env is ignored when source is set).
  - promProbe: endpoint (Prometheus base URL, e.g. "http://prometheus-server.monitoring.svc:9090"; probe appends /api/v1/query), PromQL source — exactly ONE of query (inline string) XOR queryPath (file path inside probe container); ASK which one and never set both. comparator: type MUST be "float" (PromQL is numeric — reject any other type), criteria from {== | != | >= | <= | > | <}, value as a numeric string (e.g. "0.05" for a 5% error-budget). Optional auth: type=Basic|Bearer + credentials (plain or "<+secrets.getValue('...')>"); omit auth entirely for unauthenticated in-cluster Prometheus. Optional tlsConfig: caFile, certFile, keyFile, insecureSkipVerify.
  - k8sProbe (Kubernetes infra ONLY): version (required, e.g. "v1"), resource (required, plural lowercase, e.g. "deployments"), operation (required, one of: "create" | "delete" | "present" | "absent"). Optional: group (e.g. "apps" for Deployments; omit for core resources like Pods/ConfigMaps), namespace, resourceNames (comma-separated specific names), fieldSelector (e.g. "metadata.name=checkout"), labelSelector (e.g. "app=checkout"). Prefer "present"/"absent" for steady-state liveness assertions; reserve "create"/"delete" for action probes.
  - datadogProbe (Kubernetes + Linux): datadogSite (required, host only — e.g. "us5.datadoghq.com", "datadoghq.com", "datadoghq.eu", "ap1.datadoghq.com"; see https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/), datadogCredentialsSecretName (REQUIRED on Kubernetes — name of k8s secret containing "dd-api-key" and "dd-app-key"; ignored on Linux). Source — EXACTLY ONE of metrics XOR syntheticsTest; ASK which one and never set both. metrics: query (Datadog metrics query string), timeFrame (relative range matching /^now-\\d+[smh]$/ — e.g. "now-1m", "now-5m", "now-1h"; plain "now" is INVALID), comparator (type MUST be "float", criteria from {== | != | >= | <= | > | <}, value as numeric string). syntheticsTest: testType ("api" | "browser") + publicId (Datadog Public ID of the test).
  - dynatraceProbe (Kubernetes + Linux infra; NOT Windows): endpoint (required, Dynatrace tenant URL — e.g. "https://abc.live.dynatrace.com" SaaS or "https://abc.dynatrace-managed.com/e/<env-id>" Managed), timeFrame (required, e.g. "now-1m" / "now-5m" / "now-1h" — Dynatrace expression syntax setting the aggregation window), metrics (required object with metricsSelector e.g. "builtin:host.cpu.usage" + entitySelector e.g. "type(HOST)"; both required), comparator (required: type MUST be "float" since Dynatrace metrics are numeric, criteria from {== | != | >= | <= | > | <}, value as a numeric string). Optional: apiTokenSecretName (Kubernetes secret holding the Dynatrace API token).
  - apmProbe (NOT promProbe — see Step 1 reminder): apmProbe wraps an APM backend via a Harness CONNECTOR. If the user has only a Prometheus URL and no Harness Prometheus connector, redirect them to promProbe and stop. Otherwise ASK apm_type from { Prometheus | AppDynamics | SplunkObservability | Dynatrace | NewRelic | GcpCloudMonitoring | Datadog | SplunkEnterprise }. Phase 1 — Prometheus is the only structured sub-type; the others are passthrough (walk the user through inputs per the Harness API).
    Prometheus sub-flow (apm_type=Prometheus — uses a Harness Prometheus CONNECTOR, NOT a raw URL; run sub-steps in order, pause after each):
      Step 4-B (connector picker — REQUIRED MCP call): Call harness_list resource_type=connector with type=Prometheus, include_all_connectors_available_at_scope=true (and the user's resource_scope; default project). Show the returned connectors (name, identifier, scope) and ASK the user to pick ONE — store its identifier as connectorID (the bare identifier string, NOT a connectorRef expression and NOT a URL). Do NOT proceed without an explicit pick. If the list is empty, tell the user no Prometheus connector exists and offer either to create one (separate flow) or to use promProbe instead.
      Step 4-C (TLS config — optional): ASK whether the user wants TLS (yes|no). If yes, for EACH of caCrt / clientCrt / key (any subset is allowed): call harness_list resource_type=secret with type=SecretText, include_all_secrets_accessible_at_scope=true. Show the list, ASK the user to pick ONE secret per field. Wrap each as { identifier: "secrets.getValue(\\"<secretId>\\")" } — this shape is apmProbe-specific and DIFFERS from promProbe.tlsConfig (which uses plain caFile/certFile/keyFile string paths). Then ASK insecureSkipVerify (true|false).
      Step 4-D (query — REQUIRED): ASK the user for the PromQL query (free text). Same query language as promProbe.query, but it will execute against the connector-resolved endpoint, not a URL provided here.
      Step 4-E (comparator — REQUIRED): comparator.type is locked to "float" (do NOT ask). ASK criteria from { == | != | >= | <= | > | < } and value (numeric string).
      Assemble probe_properties.apmProbe = { comparator, type: "Prometheus", prometheusProbeInputs: { connectorID, query, tlsConfig? } } and continue to Step 5.
    For other apm_type values (AppDynamics/SplunkObservability/Dynatrace/NewRelic/GcpCloudMonitoring/Datadog/SplunkEnterprise) the connector list call uses a per-type connector type — for SplunkObservability use connector type "SignalFX", for SplunkEnterprise use "Splunk", others use the apm_type name verbatim. Inputs object key is <camel(apm_type)>ProbeInputs (e.g. appDynamicsProbeInputs, datadogApmProbeInputs). These remain passthrough until Phase 2.
  - Other types (sloProbe, containerProbe): supply the matching camelCase key under probe_properties per the Harness API. Walk the user through the relevant fields — do NOT pre-pick anything.
  Do NOT pre-pick ANY field, even ones with sensible defaults.
 Strictly follow the order of steps and don't skip any step. Now move to Step 5.

Step 5 — Collect runProperties (applies to ALL probes — ask each field):
  timeout (e.g. "10s"), interval (e.g. "2s"), attempt (integer), pollingInterval (e.g. "30s"), initialDelay (e.g. "5s"), stopOnFailure (true/false), verbosity (info | debug).
  Do NOT default any of these silently — even though server-side defaults exist, ASK each one.

Step 6 — PREVIEW + CONFIRM (MANDATORY gate before submit):
  Render the full assembled body to the user as a fenced JSON code block. STOP and wait for an EXPLICIT confirmation ("yes" / "create it" / "go" / "confirm"). Do NOT call harness_create until the user explicitly approves.
  If the user asks for changes, edit the body and re-show the updated preview — repeat until they approve.
  Strictly follow the order of steps and don't skip any step. Never submit unsolicited.

EXCEPTION — clone mode:
  If the user says "like <X>" / "similar to <X>" / "duplicate <X>" / "same as before <X>": call harness_get(resource_type=chaos_probe, probe_id=<X>) to fetch the source probe, copy its probe_properties + run_properties + variables + tags VERBATIM, then ASK only about fields the user wants to change (typically probe_id + name). Step 6 (PREVIEW + CONFIRM) still applies — show the assembled body and wait for explicit approval before submit.

Only after Steps 1–5 are completed AND Step 6 has explicit user approval should you call harness_create.

INPUT FIELDS:
  probe_id (string, required): unique probe identifier within the project, [a-z0-9-]+.
  name (string, required): human-readable probe name.
  type (string, required): probe type discriminator — see Step 1 for valid (infra, type) combinations.
  infrastructure_type (string, required): Kubernetes | Linux | Windows.
  description (string, optional): free-form description.
  tags (string[] | comma-separated string, optional): tags array, "key:value" each.
  is_enabled (boolean, optional): defaults to true server-side.
  probe_properties (object, required): exactly one inner key matching \`type\`.
  run_properties (object, optional): timeout, interval, attempt, pollingInterval, initialDelay, stopOnFailure, verbosity.
  variables (array, optional): probe-level template variables: [{ name, type, value, required, description }].
  inputs (array, optional): advanced template inputs. Usually [].

ERRORS:
  400: Missing required fields or invalid (infra, type) pairing.
  401: Unauthorized.
  500: Internal server error (e.g. for cmdProbe: "failed to convert cmd probe source to string" — means source was passed as a JSON object instead of a JSON-encoded string).`;

export const descBodyProbeCreate = `Body for chaos probe create.

Required: probe_id (slug), name, type, infrastructure_type, probe_properties.<typeKey>.
Optional: description, tags, is_enabled (default true server-side), run_properties, variables, inputs.

probe_properties contains exactly ONE inner key matching type. For type=httpProbe set probe_properties.httpProbe; for type=cmdProbe set probe_properties.cmdProbe; for type=promProbe set probe_properties.promProbe (raw Prometheus URL, no connector); for type=k8sProbe set probe_properties.k8sProbe; for type=datadogProbe set probe_properties.datadogProbe; for type=dynatraceProbe set probe_properties.dynatraceProbe; for type=apmProbe set probe_properties.apmProbe (DIFFERENT from promProbe — apmProbe wraps a Harness CONNECTOR; Prometheus sub-type fully documented below; AppDynamics/SplunkObservability/Dynatrace/NewRelic/GcpCloudMonitoring/Datadog/SplunkEnterprise sub-types pass through). Other types (sloProbe, containerProbe): supply the matching camelCase key per the Harness API — accepted as passthrough.

run_properties (all optional, server defaults): timeout, interval, attempt, pollingInterval, initialDelay, stopOnFailure, verbosity (info|debug).

For httpProbe, also ask the user about: response body assertion (responseBody — alternative to responseCode), auth (Basic|Bearer or omit), tlsConfig (mTLS / custom CA / insecureSkipVerify), headers. If method=POST: contentType (e.g. application/json) and payload via body XOR bodyPath.

For cmdProbe, also ask the user about: execution mode (inline if a generic shell will do; source pod when the command needs an app-specific image like redis-cli, psql, kubectl), source.image when sourced, source.inheritInputs (reuse experiment env/volumes), env vars (top-level cmdProbe.env for inline; source.env with full corev1.EnvVar shape supporting valueFrom.secretKeyRef / configMapKeyRef for source mode). WIRE FORMAT for source: a JSON-ENCODED STRING, NOT a JSON object. Build the source spec object then JSON.stringify() it. Backend rejects object payloads with "failed to convert cmd probe source to string".

For promProbe, also ask the user about: endpoint (in-cluster example "http://prometheus-server.monitoring.svc:9090"; the probe appends /api/v1/query), PromQL source via query (inline) XOR queryPath (file path inside the probe container) — exactly one, never both. comparator.type is locked to "float" (reject any other value); comparator.criteria from {== | != | >= | <= | > | <}; comparator.value is a numeric string. Optional auth (type=Basic|Bearer + credentials, or omit entirely). Optional tlsConfig (caFile/certFile/keyFile/insecureSkipVerify) for HTTPS / mTLS Prometheus. Common pattern: bound a golden signal (error rate, latency, saturation) during chaos.

For k8sProbe, also ask the user about: GVR triplet — group (optional, e.g. "apps" for Deployments; omit for core resources like Pods/ConfigMaps), version (required, e.g. "v1"), resource (required, plural lowercase). operation (required, one of "create" | "delete" | "present" | "absent" — prefer present/absent for steady-state liveness assertions). Selectors: namespace, resourceNames (comma-separated specific names), fieldSelector (e.g. "metadata.name=checkout"), labelSelector (e.g. "app=checkout"). Note: k8sProbe is Kubernetes infra only.

For datadogProbe, also ask the user about: datadogSite (host-only Datadog region identifier — e.g. "us5.datadoghq.com", "datadoghq.com", "datadoghq.eu"; see https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/), datadogCredentialsSecretName (REQUIRED on Kubernetes — Kubernetes secret containing "dd-api-key" and "dd-app-key"; ignored on Linux). Which assertion source: metrics XOR syntheticsTest. metrics requires query (Datadog metrics query), timeFrame (relative range matching /^now-\\d+[smh]$/ — e.g. "now-1m"; plain "now" is INVALID), comparator (type locked to "float", numeric criteria, numeric-string value). syntheticsTest requires testType ("api" | "browser") + publicId (Datadog test Public ID). Common patterns: bound a Datadog metric (CPU/latency/error-rate) during chaos; verify a Datadog synthetic test still passes.

For dynatraceProbe, also ask the user about: endpoint (Dynatrace tenant URL — SaaS "https://abc.live.dynatrace.com" or Managed "https://abc.dynatrace-managed.com/e/<env-id>"), timeFrame (aggregation window in Dynatrace syntax, e.g. "now-1m" / "now-5m"), apiTokenSecretName (optional — Kubernetes secret holding the Dynatrace API token), metrics.metricsSelector (e.g. "builtin:host.cpu.usage", "builtin:service.errors.total.rate"), metrics.entitySelector (scopes the metric to specific entities, e.g. "type(HOST)", "type(SERVICE),tag(\\"env:prod\\")"). comparator.type is locked to "float" (Dynatrace metrics are numeric); comparator.criteria from {== | != | >= | <= | > | <}; comparator.value as a numeric string. Common pattern: bound a SaaS observability metric (CPU, latency, error count) during chaos.

For apmProbe (Prometheus sub-type), also ask the user about: apmProbe.type=Prometheus (discriminator). NOTE — apmProbe is NOT promProbe: apmProbe wraps a Harness Prometheus CONNECTOR (you pass connectorID); promProbe queries a Prometheus URL DIRECTLY (you pass endpoint). If the user has only a URL and no connector, switch them to promProbe. Inputs: prometheusProbeInputs.connectorID (Harness Prometheus connector identifier — discover via harness_list resource_type=connector type=Prometheus include_all_connectors_available_at_scope=true; pass the bare identifier, NOT a connectorRef expression and NOT a URL). prometheusProbeInputs.query (PromQL string). prometheusProbeInputs.tlsConfig (optional, shape DIFFERS from promProbe.tlsConfig) — caCrt/clientCrt/key each wrapped as { identifier: "secrets.getValue(\\"<secretId>\\")" } (discover secrets via harness_list resource_type=secret type=SecretText include_all_secrets_accessible_at_scope=true), plus insecureSkipVerify (boolean). comparator.type is locked to "float" (Prometheus metrics are numeric); criteria from {== | != | >= | <= | > | <}; value as a numeric string. Common pattern: bound a Prometheus metric (CPU, latency, error rate) during chaos via a managed Harness Prometheus connector.

Runtime: any value inside probe_properties or run_properties may be a Harness runtime expression like "<+input>" (resolved at experiment run time) — useful for parameterising probes via variables/inputs.

Filters (tool_type, environment_id, tags, sort_field, sort_ascending, search) must be passed inside harness_list's 'filters' object, e.g. filters: { tool_type: "Locust" }.

  (b) Host / Target URL -> target_url (fixed|<+input>) -> toolConfig.<tool>.tunables.targetUrl. LOCUST + K6 ONLY (not exposed for JMeter -- see JMeter step notes), optional. K6 additionally derives tunables.hostUrl from the URL's origin (feeds the script as __ENV.HOST_URL); leave blank if the script/locustfile declares its own host.

  (g) RPS Limit -> rps_limit (fixed|<+input>) -> toolConfig.k6.tunables.rpsLimit. K6 ONLY. Global cap, split evenly across replicas; always applies (unlike (c)/(d)/(f), which k6 ignores once the script declares its own scenarios/stages).
  (h) Worker Count / Replicas -> worker_count (fixed|<+input>) -> toolConfig.<tool>.tunables.workerCount. LOCUST + K6 + JMETER, Kubernetes only (VM always runs a single worker/pod -- skip entirely for target_type='machine-chaos-linux'). Locust: Users are DISTRIBUTED across workers, not multiplied. K6: <=1 = single pod; higher values fan out to multiple runner pods via --execution-segment. JMeter: workers MULTIPLY load -- each injector runs the FULL uploaded plan unchanged; thread counts inside the file are NOT sliced across workers.
  (i) Environment Variables -> env_vars -> toolConfig.<tool>.envVars[]. K6 + JMETER. Structured array; each entry is a literal {key, value}, a runtime {key, value: "<+input>"}, or a secret reference {key, secret_id, secret_scope?}. See the env_vars field's own description (descLoadtestEnvVars) for the full validator, reserved-name list, and secret_scope discovery flow (harness_list resource_type=secret type=SecretText) -- not repeated here.

export const descCreateLoadtest = `Creates a Locust load test (Resilience Testing) on a Linux VM or Kubernetes load-runner infrastructure.
IMPORTANT: You MUST NOT auto-select, assume, or pre-fill any value on behalf of the user.
At every step below, present the options / ask for the value and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
Do NOT assume org/project/infrastructure/script/URL based on previous activity — the user may choose differently each time.
Locust (Python), K6 (JavaScript), and JMeter (Java) are supported. K6 and JMeter are Kubernetes-only; Linux VM supports Locust only. All three tools support "Upload script" and "Using Custom Image" via scalar inputs (script, script_image, script_entrypoint, load_args, image_pull_secret) plus tool-specific extras (properties/thresholds for JMeter; env_vars for K6/JMeter). The 'tool_config' body field remains available as an advanced escape hatch (e.g. JMeter .zip bundles pre-base64'd into tool_config.jmeter.script.content). For K6, "Define test via UI" is deferred.
Required workflow -- follow in order, pausing for user input after each step.
COMMON STEPS (identical for Locust, K6, and JMeter):
Each step below shows the slice of the canonical stored LoadTest YAML that its inputs populate (what the user sees in the Harness UI YAML view). You NEVER hand-write this YAML -- MCP synthesizes it from the scalars/objects you pass to harness_create; the slices exist only so you can reason about which of your inputs affects which YAML path and echo an accurate preview back to the user.
Two paths of the stored YAML are set from top-level body fields rather than the MCP-built manifest itself and are merged by the backend: metadata.serviceReferences (from body.service_references) and spec.cleanupPolicy (from body.cleanup_policy). All other YAML paths below correspond 1:1 to what MCP writes into body.yaml.

Step 1 -- Name / description / tags:
  Ask for a name (any non-empty string) -> name. identity is auto-derived from name by stripping non-alphanumerics unless the user supplies one (letters / numbers / underscores).
  description and tags are optional -- ask, but do not require them.
  YAML populated after this step:
    kind: LoadTest
    apiVersion: v1alpha1
    metadata:
      name: <name>
      description: <description>        # omitted when empty
      tags:                             # omitted when empty
        - <tag>
    spec:
      identity: <identity>              # auto-derived slug from name unless user supplies one

Step 2 -- Execution environment target type:
  Ask "Linux VM" (target_type=machine-chaos-linux) or "Kubernetes" (target_type=kubernetes). Wait for the user to choose.
  Linux VM supports Locust only. Kubernetes supports Locust, K6, or JMeter.
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      targetType: kubernetes | machine-chaos-linux
      infraType:  kubernetes | linux    # derived from targetType, not user-supplied

Step 3 -- Load-runner infrastructure (see chaos_loadtest.relatedResources for canonical guidance):
  Linux VM   -> harness_list resource_type=chaos_infrastructure           (loadEnabled + ACTIVE only).
  Kubernetes -> harness_list resource_type=chaos_enabled_infrastructure   (already ACTIVE + chaos-enabled).
  From the chosen row: environmentID -> environment_id, infraID -> infra_id. Do NOT choose an infra yourself.
  If NO eligible infra is returned (empty list, or every row fails the eligibility filter above), STOP and tell the user no eligible load-runner infra exists in the current scope. Ask them to (a) switch org/project scope, (b) pick a different target type at Step 2 (Linux VM <-> Kubernetes), or (c) exit/stop. Do NOT fall back to an ineligible infra and do NOT proceed to Step 4 -- a load test cannot be created without an eligible infra.
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      infraId: <infraID from the chosen infra row>
      envId:   <environmentID from the chosen infra row>

Step 4 -- Resilience Testing Services (chaos_service):
  Call harness_list resource_type=chaos_service with infrastructure_ids='<environment_id>/<infra_id>'. Show the list to the user.
  The user may (a) pick one or more identities from the list, OR (b) onboard a brand-new service via chaos_service's create flow -- offer BOTH options regardless of whether the list is empty. Pass the chosen identity/identities as service_references.
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    metadata:
      serviceReferences:                # merged in by backend from the top-level service_references body field
        - <chaos_service identity>
        - ...
  Passed on the wire as body.service_references (snake_case scalar), NOT as part of the yaml manifest MCP builds -- the backend writes it into the stored YAML at metadata.serviceReferences.

Step 5 -- Tool type:
  Linux VM: Locust only. Kubernetes: ask Locust / K6 / JMeter.
  Pass tool_type='Locust' | 'K6' | 'JMeter'. K6 and JMeter with a non-Kubernetes target_type will be rejected by MCP.
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      toolType: Locust | K6 | JMeter
      cleanupPolicy: delete             # default; see Step 7a to override or add spec.resources (Step 7b)
      toolConfig:
        <lowercase(toolType)>:          # e.g. locust / k6 / jmeter
          mode: script | image          # tool_config detail filled in Step 6
          script:
            content: ""                 # base64 on the wire, decoded plain-text in the YAML view; filled in Step 6
          tunables:                     # filled in Step 8 (load configuration)
            targetUsers: <int>
            durationSeconds: <int>
            rampUpTimeSec: <int>
            workerCount: <int>          # Kubernetes only
  Notes:
   - All three tools (Locust / K6 / JMeter) populate toolConfig.<tool> from Step-6 scalars -- no hand-built tool_config needed for standard flows. JMeter's tool_config remains available only as an advanced escape hatch (e.g. pre-base64'd .zip bundles).
   - JMeter has no target_url / users / duration / ramp_up scalar surface -- load shape is baked into the uploaded plan (script mode) or the container image (custom image mode). Server defaults 100/600/30 for missing tunables on save.

Step 6 -- Tool-specific configuration (branch on tool_type from Step 5):
Every tool type supports two authoring modes:
  (a) Upload script (script_source='inline', mode='script') -- paste the raw script; MCP base64-encodes it into toolConfig.<tool>.script.content.
  (b) Using Custom Image (script_source='image', mode='image') -- point at a prebuilt container image; no script is uploaded.
Mode lives at toolConfig.<tool>.mode; script_source on the wire body mirrors it ('inline' <-> 'script', 'image' <-> 'image').
Fields marked (*) in a branch below are MANDATORY for that branch -- the UI (and MCP validation) reject creation with any '*' field empty. Unmarked fields are OPTIONAL.
Fixed vs runtime input: fields noted "(fixed|<+input>)" below accept EITHER a concrete value NOW, OR the literal string '<+input>' meaning "prompt for this value at run time". Pass the placeholder verbatim -- MCP forwards it as-is into the tunables and into the base64 YAML manifest.
Shared field taxonomy -- each branch below references these by letter instead of restating them:
${descLoadtestFieldTaxonomy}

Step 6.LocustScript -- Locust + Upload Python script (mode='script'):

  Ask, in order: (*)(a) Script file, (b) Host URL, (*)(c) Users, (*)(d) Duration, (*)(e) Ramp Up, (h) Worker Count [Kubernetes only].
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      toolConfig:
        locust:
          mode: script
          script:
            content: |                        # plain text in YAML view; base64 on wire
              <the Python locust script>
          tunables:                           # omit keys the user left blank
            targetUrl: http://www.example.com
            targetUsers: 100

            rampUpTimeSec: 120
            workerCount: 1                    # Kubernetes only

Step 6.LocustImage -- Locust + Using Custom Image (mode='image'):
  Kubernetes only (script_source=image, or inferred when script_image is set). VM is always inline.
  Ask, in order:
    (b) Host URL                 -> target_url          (optional; Locust --host; leave blank if the locustfile sets host in code)
    (a) Load Test Image*         -> script_image        (required; container image, e.g. my-registry/my-load-test:latest)
    (a) Entrypoint               -> script_entrypoint   (optional; path inside the image, e.g. /scripts/locustfile.py; passed to locust -f; backend falls back to a default when omitted)
    (a) Load args                -> load_args           (optional; semicolon-separated k=v pairs, e.g. "tags=smoke,fast;headless=true" -- NOT bare CLI flags)
    (a) Image Registry Type      -> Public: omit image_pull_secret
                                    Private: image_pull_secret (name of the Kubernetes image-pull secret)
    (c) Users*                   -> users
    (d) Duration*                -> duration_sec
    (e) Ramp Up*                 -> ramp_up_sec
    (h) Worker Count             -> worker_count        (K8s; 0/omit = standalone)
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      toolConfig:
        locust:
          mode: image
          script:
            image: my-registry/my-load-test:latest
            entrypoint: /scripts/locustfile.py
            loadArgs: tags=smoke                     # omit when blank
            imagePullSecret: my-pull-secret          # omit when Public
          tunables:                                  # omit keys the user left blank
            targetUrl: https://www.google.com
            targetUsers: 100
            durationSeconds: 600
            rampUpTimeSec: 120
            workerCount: 1

Step 6.K6Script -- K6 + Upload K6 script (mode='script'):
  Kubernetes-only: MCP rejects K6 with target_type='machine-chaos-linux' at create time.
  Ask, in order: (*)(a) Script file [MANDATORY: script MUST contain 'export default function ...' -- reject before calling MCP if missing, matching Harness UI validateScriptContent], (b) Host URL, (c) Users, (d) Duration, (f) Iterations, (g) RPS Limit, (i) Environment Variables, (h) Replicas.
  Load-profile semantics reminder: (c)/(d)/(f) are ignored by k6 once the script declares its own scenarios/stages -- leave them blank for scripted scenarios. (g) RPS Limit always applies.
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      toolConfig:
        k6:
          mode: script
          script:
            content: |                        # plain text in YAML view; base64 on wire

          tunables:                           # omit keys the user left blank
            targetUrl: https://www.examplek6.com
            targetUsers: <+input>
            durationSeconds: <+input>
            iterations: <+input>
            workerCount: 1
            rpsLimit: 100

            - { key: somekey, value: secrets.getValue("account.gcp-ca-cert"), secret: true }   # scope prefix per env_vars docs: account./org./none for project

Step 6.K6Image -- K6 + Using Custom Image (mode='image'):
  Kubernetes only (script_source=image, or inferred when script_image is set).
  Ask, in order:
    (b) Host URL                 -> target_url          (optional; MCP derives toolConfig.k6.tunables.hostUrl from its origin)
    (a) Load Test Image*         -> script_image        (required; container image, e.g. my-registry/my-load-test:latest)
    (a) Entrypoint               -> script_entrypoint   (optional; path inside the image, e.g. /script.js; backend falls back to a default when omitted)
    (a) Load args                -> load_args           (optional; semicolon-separated k=v pairs, e.g. "tags=smoke,fast;headless=true" -- NOT bare CLI flags)
    (a) Image Registry Type      -> Public: omit image_pull_secret
                                    Private: image_pull_secret (name of the Kubernetes image-pull secret)
    (h) Worker Count             -> worker_count        (K8s; 0/omit = standalone)
    (g) RPS Limit                -> rps_limit           (optional; toolConfig.k6.tunables.rpsLimit when > 0)
    (i) Environment Variables    -> env_vars            (see Step 4c)
  Note: Users/Duration/Iterations tunables are meaningless for image mode -- the bundled script controls its own scenarios/stages. Do not ask for them here.
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      toolConfig:
        k6:
          mode: image
          script:
            image: my-registry/my-load-test:latest   # or <+input>
            entrypoint: /script.js                   # or <+input>
            loadArgs: tags=smoke                     # omit when blank
            imagePullSecret: my-pull-secret          # omit when Public
          tunables:
            workerCount: 1
            rpsLimit: 100                            # omit when rps_limit is unset
          envVars:                                   # omit entirely when no env vars are set
            - { key: someKey, value: someValue, secret: false }

Step 6.JMeterScript -- JMeter + Upload JMX / XML / ZIP (mode='script'):
  Kubernetes-only: MCP rejects JMeter with target_type='machine-chaos-linux' at create time.
  Ask, in order: (*)(a) Test Plan file [.jmx/.xml -- raw plan text, verbatim; do NOT parse, modify, or pre-encode. A .zip bundle (plan + CSV data/dependencies) is also accepted but must be supplied pre-base64'd via tool_config.jmeter.script.content instead of the scalar 'script' field], (j) Property Overrides, (i) Environment Variables, (k) Thresholds, (h) Workers.
  Notes: (b)/(c)/(d)/(e)/(f)/(g) do not apply to JMeter -- thread count, ramp-up, and duration live inside the uploaded plan's ThreadGroup elements, not as separate MCP inputs. If the user wants to change load shape, tell them to edit the .jmx and re-upload (or use tool_config.jmeter.tunables.{targetUsers,durationSeconds,rampUpTimeSec} as an advanced override -- backend-accepted but not exposed as a scalar here since the Harness UI does not expose it either).
  YAML populated after this step (delta only):
    spec:
      toolConfig:
        jmeter:
          mode: script
          script:
            content: |                        # plain text in YAML view; base64 on wire
              <the .jmx/.xml plan>
          tunables:
            workerCount: 1                    # Kubernetes only
          properties:                         # omit entirely when no property overrides are set
            - { key: someProperty, value: someValue, sendToEngines: true }
          envVars:                            # omit entirely when no env vars are set
            - { key: secretKeyAtProject, value: secrets.getValue("datat-api"), secret: true }
            - { key: fixedKey, value: fixedValue }
            - { key: RuntimeKey, value: <+input> }
          thresholds:                         # omit entirely when no thresholds are set
            - { metric: response_time_ms, stat: p95, operator: <, value: 5000, abortOnFail: false }

Step 6.JMeterImage -- JMeter + Using Custom Image (mode='image'):
  Kubernetes-only (script_source=image, or inferred when script_image is set). Custom Image does NOT slice load -- each worker runs the full command independently, so total load ~= plan threads * injectors. Users/Duration/Ramp-up are baked into the image's plan and are NOT asked here (server defaults 100/600/30 when omitted; do not surface them).
  Ask, in order:
    (a) Load Test Image*         -> script_image        (required; cluster-reachable container image, e.g. my-registry/jmeter:5.6; may be '<+input>')
    (a) Entrypoint               -> script_entrypoint   (optional; path to the .jmx/.xml test plan inside the image, e.g. /test/plan.jmx; may be '<+input>'; backend falls back to a default plan-file name when omitted)
    (a) Load args                -> load_args           (optional; JMeter GNU-style long options as semicolon-separated key=value pairs OR bare flags, e.g. "proxyHost=10.0.0.1;forceDeleteResultFile". Each becomes --key=value. Do NOT put JMeter properties (jmeter.save.saveservice.* or \${__P(...)} vars) here -- those go in Property Overrides / -J / -G. Keys must be non-empty, contain no whitespace, and must NOT start with '-')
    (a) Image Registry Type      -> Public: omit image_pull_secret
                                    Private: image_pull_secret (name of the Kubernetes image-pull secret)
    (j) Property Overrides       -> properties          (optional; array of {key, value, send_to_engines?}. send_to_engines=true adds -G so the property reaches remote workers in Distributed Execution)

Step 7 -- Advanced Options (all tool types; identical for Locust/K6/JMeter):

Step 7a -- Cleanup Policy:
  Ask whether to keep the default -> cleanup_policy='delete' (removes run pods/configmaps/secrets after each execution), or retain them for debugging -> cleanup_policy='retain'. Maps to spec.cleanupPolicy. Mirrors the UI's Advanced Options "Clean-up Load Resources" toggle (ON = delete, OFF = retain).

Step 7b -- Resource Requirements (Kubernetes only; OFF by default -- skip unless the user opts in):
  If the user wants to set CPU/memory limits and requests, ask for any of: limits.cpu, limits.memory, requests.cpu, requests.memory (all optional individually). Pass resources={ limits?: {cpu?, memory?}, requests?: {cpu?, memory?} }. cpu is cores/millicores (e.g. "100m", "0.5", "2"); memory is a whole-byte quantity (e.g. "128Mi", "1Gi", "134217728"). Per resource, requests must not exceed limits. Maps to spec.resources. If the user declines, omit 'resources' entirely.
  YAML populated after Step 7 (delta only):
    spec:
      cleanupPolicy: retain              # 'delete' when omitted/unset

Only after the user confirms all of the above (across Steps 1-7) should you call harness_create resource_type=chaos_loadtest. The full input-field reference lives on each field's own description (bodySchema.fields) -- do NOT restate it here.
Returns the created load test, including the full toolConfig echo (script/tunables/options/envVars as stored), serviceReferences, cleanupPolicy, resources, the base64 canonical yaml, createdAt/updatedAt, and an openInHarness deep link.`;
export const descDeleteLoadtest = `Delete a load test instance`;

export const descUpdateLoadtest = `Update fields on an existing load test (PUT -- partial by field, full-replace within a field). Omit a field entirely to leave it unchanged.

- name / description / tags / environment_id / infra_id / target_type / max_duration_sec: simple scalar replace when supplied.
- service_references / variables: replace the ENTIRE list when non-null (a non-null service_references must still be non-empty); there is no per-item merge.
- cleanup_policy / resources: identical top-level spec fields to create -- see their own field descriptions (descLoadtestCleanupPolicy / descLoadtestResources). Not repeated here.
- Editing the script, image, tunables, properties, thresholds, or env vars (toolConfig.<tool>) requires resupplying the FULL desired sub-object -- the backend overwrites toolConfig.<tool> wholesale on any non-null write (no per-field merge server-side, except variables and JMeter's masked-.zip workspace preservation). You have two ways to do this:
  1. Scalar fields (recommended, mirrors create): supply 'tool_type' (Locust/K6/JMeter -- required, NOT itself sent to the API since tool_type is immutable after creation; used only so MCP picks the right builder) plus any of the same scalar fields create accepts (target_url, script_source, script, script_image, script_entrypoint, load_args, image_pull_secret, users, spawn_rate, duration_sec, ramp_up_sec, worker_count, host_url, rps_limit, iterations, env_vars, properties, thresholds). MCP rebuilds the complete toolConfig.<tool> object from these exactly as it does on create -- you must resupply every scalar that should remain set, not just the ones changing. Field-to-path mapping:

${descLoadtestFieldTaxonomy}
  2. 'tool_config' escape hatch: hand-construct the object yourself (e.g. to preserve a JMeter .zip workspace or other advanced shape not covered by scalars). Pass 'tool_type' alongside it so MCP wraps/unwraps consistently with create; omitting 'tool_type' falls back to legacy behavior where 'tool_config' is sent to the API completely as-is (must already be the full \`{ <tool>: {...} }\` wire shape).
- No 'yaml' manifest is sent on update (unlike create) -- the typed JSON fields above (cleanupPolicy, resources, toolConfig) are authoritative since the backend falls back to them whenever no yaml body is supplied.

Returns the updated load test (same shape as harness_get resource_type=chaos_loadtest).`;

- Use chaos_k8s_infrastructure for the FULL inventory (including not-yet-chaos-enabled and INACTIVE/PENDING infra), single-infra detail (get), health checks (check_health), or filtering by a specific non-ACTIVE status. Its pagination/totals span all platform infra, not just chaos-ready ones, so client-side isChaosEnabled filtering there gives wrong page sizes/counts.

// ── Action Descriptions ──────────────────────────────────────────────

export const descRunExperiment = `Trigger a new chaos experiment run. This is an action — it starts execution.
Returns notifyId, experimentRunId, experimentId, and experimentName.

Step 0 — Inspect the action contract FIRST:
  Call harness_describe with resource_type=chaos_experiment and look at the run execute action. It lists every accepted input field (inputset_identity, runtime_inputs, experiment_variables, tasks, is_identity) with type and description. Do NOT skip this step — it is the source of truth for what the action accepts, and is how you discover knobs like is_identity (controls slug vs UUID lookup for experiment_id).

IMPORTANT: You MUST follow this workflow before triggering a run. Do NOT skip steps or auto-fill values.

Step 1 — Discover runtime variables:
  Call harness_list resource_type=chaos_experiment_variable with resource_id=<experiment_id> to list the experiment's runtime inputs.
  If no variables are returned, the experiment needs no overrides — skip to Step 4.
  If variables exist, show them to the user (name, type, default value) and proceed to Step 2.

Step 2 — Check for saved input sets:
  Call harness_list resource_type=chaos_input_set with experiment_id=<experiment_id>.
  If input sets exist, present them to the user as reusable presets (show identity, name, description).
  If none exist, skip to Step 3.

Step 3 — User chooses how to provide runtime values (one of four paths):

  (a) Use a saved input set as-is:
      User selects an input set from Step 2.
      Pass inputset_identity=<selected identity> in the request body. Do NOT pass runtime_inputs.
      The backend fetches the stored values and applies them.

  (b) Use a saved input set as a starting point, then modify some values:
      Fetch the selected input set via harness_get resource_type=chaos_input_set (with experiment_id and inputset_id).
      Parse its spec field — format: { experiment: [{name, value}], tasks: { taskName: [{name, value}] } }.
      Show the values to the user and let them change the ones they want to override.
      Send the MERGED result as experiment_variables/tasks (or runtime_inputs) in the request body.
      Do NOT pass inputset_identity — the backend ignores it when runtime_inputs is present.

  (c) Provide all values manually:
      User supplies values for each variable from Step 1.
      Pass them via experiment_variables and/or tasks (or runtime_inputs). Do NOT pass inputset_identity.

  (d) No overrides needed:
      User confirms they want to run with defaults. Send an empty body {}.

PRIORITY RULE: runtime_inputs (or experiment_variables/tasks) and inputset_identity are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE.
If runtime_inputs is present in the body, inputset_identity is silently ignored by the backend — there is no merge.
Never pass both. If the user wants to start from an input set but change some values, use path (b) above.

Step 4 — Trigger the run:
  Call harness_execute resource_type=chaos_experiment action=run with the experiment_id and chosen body.

Step 5 — Poll for results:
  Use chaos_experiment_run get with the returned experimentRunId to check status and resiliency score.
  Poll periodically until phase is Completed, Completed_With_Error, Stopped, or Error.`;

IMPORTANT: You MUST NOT auto-select, assume, or pre-fill any value on behalf of the user.
At every step below, you MUST display the available options and wait for explicit user confirmation before proceeding.
NOTE: based on your previous user activies still don't assume their org/project/hub/template etc, they might would want to chose a different everytime. 

Required workflow — follow in order, pausing for user input after each step:

Step 1 — Select a hub:
  If the user has already specified a hub_identity, confirm before proceeding.
  Otherwise call harness_list resource_type=chaos_hub, show the list, and wait for them to pick one.

Step 2 — Select an experiment template:
  If the user has already specified a template_id, confirm before proceeding.
  Otherwise call harness_list resource_type=chaos_experiment_template filtered by hub_identity from Step 1,
  show the list, and wait for them to pick one. Note the template's infraType.

Step 2.5 — Discover template inputs (optional but recommended):
  Call harness_execute resource_type=chaos_experiment_template action=get_variables to surface required runtime inputs.

Step 3 — Select an environment:
  Call harness_list resource_type=chaos_environment. Show the full list and wait for the user to pick one.
  Do NOT choose an environment yourself even if only one exists.

Step 4 — Select an infrastructure:
  Call harness_list resource_type=chaos_k8s_infrastructure filtered by the environmentId from Step 3
  (optionally filter by infraType from Step 2). Show the list and wait for the user to pick one.
  Only infrastructures where status=ACTIVE AND isChaosEnabled=true are valid.
  If the user picks one that is inactive or has isChaosEnabled=false, tell them it cannot be used and ask them to choose again.
  Do NOT choose an infrastructure yourself.

Step 5 — Collect experiment details:
  Ask the user for a name and identity for the new experiment.
  Do NOT generate or assume a name without asking.
  Both must match ^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]$.

Only after all five steps are confirmed by the user should you call harness_execute action=create_from_template.
The infraId is automatically prefixed with environmentId if needed (pass infra_id + environment_id separately).
Use import_type to control linking: 'LOCAL' (copy into project, default) or 'REFERENCE' (keep live link to hub).
Returns the created experiment details including id, identity, name, infraType, infraId, and manifest.

INPUT FIELDS (pass via body or top-level params):
  template_id (string, required): Template identity to launch from (path param).
  hub_identity (string, required): ChaosHub identity containing the template (query param). Omitting returns 400.
  revision (string): Template revision (e.g. "v1"). Omit for default revision.
  account_id (string, required): Harness account identifier. Required in body — must match account scope.
  org_id (string): Organization identifier. If provided, must match query param scope.
  project_id (string): Project identifier. If provided, must match query param scope.
  name (string, required): Display name for the new experiment.
  identity (string, required): Unique identity for the new experiment (not the template).
  infra_ref (string, required): Infrastructure ref as "environmentId/infraId". Or pass infra_id + environment_id separately.
  infra_id (string): Infrastructure ID — auto-prefixed with environment_id if needed.
  environment_id (string): Environment ID — used to construct infra_ref when infra_id is provided.
  import_type (string, required): "LOCAL" (copy, default) or "REFERENCE" (linked to hub template).
  description (string): Experiment description.
  tags (string[]): Experiment tags.

ERRORS:
  400: Missing required fields (account_id, identity, infra_ref, import_type) or scope identifier mismatch between query params and body.
  401: Unauthorized — invalid user or insufficient permissions.
  500: Internal server error.

NOTES:
  - The "identity" field is for the NEW experiment being created, not the template (template is identified by template_id).
  - Scope query params (accountIdentifier, organizationIdentifier, projectIdentifier) are auto-injected — only the body scope fields (account_id, org_id, project_id) need to be passed explicitly.
  
 Note: If user wants to create an experiment from scratch (without using a template), use the create_experiment action on chaos_experiment.

IRREVERSIBLE: deletes run history, resiliency scores, probes, schedules, and input sets. Cannot be undone.

REQUIRED pre-call workflow:
1. Fetch the experiment via harness_get and display: name, identity, total runs, last run status, and last run date.
2. Ask the user: "Are you sure you want to permanently delete experiment '[name]'? This cannot be undone."
3. Do NOT proceed unless the user explicitly confirms using the experiment name (not just "yes").
4. If the user seems unsure, suggest archiving or disabling instead of deleting.

Returns experimentId, experimentName, isDeleted. Like get, this endpoint requires the internal UUID (experimentID); the UI slug will not work — list first if you only have the slug.`;

export const descStopExperiment = `Stop a chaos experiment run.
Pass experiment_id via resource_id. Pass experiment_run_id, notify_id, force via params (not inputs).
If notify_id is set, the run is found by notify_id and scope; otherwise by experiment_run_id and scope.
If both are omitted, all runs for the experiment with phase 'Running' are stopped.
force=true immediately marks the run as Stopped in the database; false (default) requests stop on cluster/machine.

export const descDeleteProbe = `Permanently delete a chaos probe by its ID.

IRREVERSIBLE: deletes the probe definition, all execution history, and reference data. Cannot be undone.

PREREQUISITES:
- The probe must be disabled first — use chaos_probe execute action: enable with is_enabled=false and is_bulk_update=true to also remove it from all experiment manifests.
- The probe must not be referenced by any experiment. Default (system) probes cannot be deleted.
- The delete call itself takes no extra parameters beyond probe_id.

REQUIRED pre-call workflow:
1. Fetch the probe via harness_get and display: name, ID, type, infrastructure type, enabled status, verified status, and reference count.
2. If the probe is still enabled, disable it first (chaos_probe execute action: enable with is_enabled=false, is_bulk_update=true).
3. Ask the user: "Are you sure you want to permanently delete probe '[name]'? This cannot be undone."
4. Do NOT proceed unless the user explicitly confirms using the probe name (not just "yes").
5. If the user seems unsure, suggest disabling instead of deleting.

// ── DR Test Descriptions ─────────────────────────────────────────────

export const descChaosDRTest = `Chaos DR Test (Disaster Recovery Test) — a DRTest-type stage inside a Harness pipeline used to validate disaster recovery readiness through chaos fault injection. Supports list and create.

Key concepts:
- A DR Test is NOT a standalone entity — it is a stage (type: DRTest) inside a Harness Pipeline tagged module=drtest. The pipeline is a transparent container; API consumers only see the stage.
- Creating a DR Test creates a pipeline skeleton with one empty DRTest stage (steps: []). Chaos steps are added later via the Pipeline Service.
- The identifier you pass becomes the stageIdentifier. The pipeline gets identifier + "_pipeline" as its pipelineIdentifier.
- The API automatically sets both discovery markers — you never pass them in the request: pipeline-level tag module=drtest (used by LIST to filter pipelines) and stage-level type=DRTest (used to extract stages).
- All three scope params are required: accountIdentifier, organizationIdentifier, projectIdentifier. The API is strictly project-scoped.

List response fields: name, identity (stage ID), description, tags (key-value map), objective (DR goal statement), and spec.pipeline containing the parent pipeline name, identity, recentRuns (executionId, status, startTs, endTs, executorInfo), and lastModified timestamp.

Pipeline access: Each DR Test is backed by a Harness pipeline (pipelineIdentifier = dr_test_id + "_pipeline", also available as spec.pipeline.identity in the DR test response). Use pipeline_id=spec.pipeline.identity as the identifier for both endpoints below.
- resource_type=pipeline_summary (harness_get): Returns lightweight pipeline metadata — name, status, tags, store type, last modified. Call this to quickly check whether the backing pipeline exists, is enabled, or has the expected module=drtest tag. Does not include the pipeline YAML.
- resource_type=pipeline (harness_get): Returns the full pipeline YAML definition. Call this when you need to inspect or reason about the pipeline's stages, steps, fault injections, or full configuration — for example to see what chaos faults are configured inside the DRTest stage.
- resource_type=pipeline (harness_execute, action=update): Replaces the full pipeline YAML. ALWAYS fetch the current YAML first (harness_get resource_type=pipeline), apply only the user-requested edits, and send back the complete YAML — omitting any field will erase it since this is a full-replace PUT.
- resource_type=pipeline (harness_execute, action=run): Triggers a pipeline execution. Check required inputs first with harness_get resource_type=runtime_input_template, resource_id=spec.pipeline.identity. Pass runtime inputs as key-value pairs (e.g. {branch: 'main'}) or use input_set_ids to reference saved input sets.
- resource_type=execution (harness_execute, action=interrupt): Interrupts a running DR test execution. Pass resource_id as the planExecutionId from spec.pipeline.recentRuns (in the DR test response). Set interrupt_type to AbortAll or UserMarkedFailure.
- resource_type=pipeline (harness_execute, action=delete): Permanently deletes the pipeline backing the DR test, which also removes the DR test itself. Use pipeline_id=spec.pipeline.identity. This is irreversible — always confirm with the user before proceeding.`;

export const descListDRTests = `List all DR Tests (disaster recovery test stages) from pipelines tagged with module=drtest.
Returns each DR Test's identity, name, description, objective, tags, and parent pipeline info with recent run statuses.
Supports pagination (page, limit) and sorting (sort).

Constraints:
- Pagination and sort apply to the underlying pipeline list, not individual DR Test stages — a page of N pipelines may yield more or fewer DR Tests since one pipeline can contain multiple DRTest stages.
- The response includes server-side pagination metadata (totalItems, totalPages) in a pagination object.
- recentRuns are at the pipeline level — all DRTest stages from the same pipeline share the same recent execution history.
- Only pipelines tagged module=drtest are returned; this filter is hardcoded and not user-configurable.
- The search parameter is accepted without error but has no effect — it is inherited from a shared query type but not wired in the backend.`;

export const descDRTestSort = `Sort field and direction for the underlying pipeline list. Format: {field},{DIRECTION}.
Valid sort fields: name (pipeline name, alphabetical), lastModified (pipeline last modification timestamp), lastExecution (pipeline most recent execution timestamp).

- A single DRTest stage inside it with identifier = <identifier>, description, objective, and tags as provided.
- The pipeline starts empty (steps: []). Add chaos steps later via the Pipeline Service.

Identifier convention:
- stageIdentifier = identifier (what you pass)

export const descIsIdentity = `Controls how experiment_id is interpreted by the backend. Pass is_identity=true to use the human-readable identity slug (e.g. "exp-without-runtime" from the UI URL). Pass is_identity=false to use the internal UUID (e.g. "ef9199b6-0248-4c0b-9d63-9176bf2b7123"). Only applies where the backend honors the toggle: chaos_experiment.run, chaos_experiment_variable.list, and chaos_input_set.{list,get,create,update,delete}.
Auto-detected when omitted for chaos_experiment.run and chaos_experiment_variable.list: if experiment_id looks like a UUID, is_identity defaults to false; otherwise it defaults to true (slug). chaos_input_set operations always default to false (UUID) regardless of shape. Pass is_identity explicitly to override the auto-detected/default value.
If the call still fails with "no documents in result", the experiment may predate the identity field, or the ID's shape may not match what was auto-detected — retry the same call with the opposite is_identity value, or use harness_list(resource_type=chaos_experiment) to find the correct UUID.`;

Linux/Windows manifest differences (infra_id body field is always composite for all types):
- metadata.namespace: absent (K8s only)
- spec.serviceAccountName: absent (K8s only)
- spec.experimentRunId: absent (K8s only, set to "" initially)
- spec.infraId: UUID alone (K8s uses composite envId/infraId)
- spec.infraType: 'Linux' or 'Windows' instead of 'KubernetesV2'
- faultRef/probeRef/actionRef infraId: same UUID as spec.infraId (K8s uses short ID e.g. 'qaauto1')`;

export const descExperimentManifest = `Full experiment specification as a JSON string. Must contain a valid apiVersion field with suffix /v1alpha1, /v1alpha2, or /v1beta1. For Kubernetes v1beta1 experiments, spec.faultRef must contain at least one fault — empty faultRef array is rejected. Empty string or invalid JSON will fail.`;

export const descExperimentInfraType = `Infrastructure type for the experiment. Required — no default value; empty/invalid errors with 'infra type is not supported'.
Valid values (case-sensitive string enum):
- "Kubernetes" — Legacy Kubernetes infrastructure (v1)
- "KubernetesV2" — New Kubernetes infrastructure (v2, recommended)
- "Linux" — Linux machine-based infrastructure
- "Windows" — Windows machine-based infrastructure
- "windows" — Lowercase alias kept for backward compatibility (prefer "Windows")
- "CloudFoundry" — Cloud Foundry infrastructure
- "Container" — Container-based infrastructure
Must be provided together with infra_id — both are required.`;

export const descExperimentInfraIdCreate = `Target infrastructure reference. Must be provided together with infra_type — both are required.
Composite format: "{environmentIdentifier}/{infrastructureIdentifier}" (e.g. "demo/qaauto1"). Applies to ALL infra types.

If infra_id is not already known, discover it:
  Step 1 — List environments: call harness_list resource_type=chaos_environment. Present environment names and identifiers to the user and let them pick one.
  Step 2 — List infrastructures: call harness_list resource_type=chaos_k8s_infrastructure (for Kubernetes/KubernetesV2) or chaos_infrastructure (for Linux/Windows/Container/CloudFoundry) with environment_id=<selected env>. Only infrastructures where status=ACTIVE AND isChaosEnabled=true are valid — exclude all others. Present only valid infras to the user. If none are valid, do not proceed.
  Step 3 — Build infra_id: combine as "{environmentIdentifier}/{infraID}" (e.g. environment "demo" + infra "qaauto1" = "demo/qaauto1").`;

export const descExperimentCronSyntax = `Optional cron expression for scheduling recurring experiment runs (e.g. '0 0 * * *' for daily). When provided, the experiment type is automatically set to CronExperimentV2. NOT validated at save time — invalid cron will fail when the schedule is actually enabled. Omit for one-time experiments.`;

// ── Service Discovery ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Service Discovery (SD) is a Chaos sub-feature. An SD agent runs in a
// Kubernetes cluster and continuously inventories the cluster using the
// Kubernetes API plus eBPF (kprobe) for real-time network traffic. The
// inventory is persisted to the Harness `servicediscovery` backend and
// consumed by Chaos Engineering to pick targets, fault types, and
// validations. All read endpoints return read-only snapshots from the
// agent's last sync.

// Shared filter / behavior descriptions
export const descSDAgentIdentity = `Service Discovery agent identity — the path segment shown in the SD UI URL (e.g. 'chaosinfra'). Each agent is bound to one Harness environment and one Kubernetes cluster.`;

export const descSDEnvironmentId = `Harness environment identifier the SD agent is bound to (e.g. 'dev'). Required by SD's AgentAccessCheck middleware to resolve the agent — the same agent identity may exist in multiple environments.`;

export const descSDAgentListEnvironmentId = `Optional narrowing filter — the LIST agents endpoint does not require it (unlike discovered_namespace/discovered_service/discovered_network_map, which use AgentAccessCheck and require both agent_identity + environment_id). Omit to list agents across every environment in scope.`;

export const descSDFetchAll = `When true, fetch every result and ignore page/limit (the API returns the full unpaginated list). Useful for small/medium clusters; avoid on very large clusters.`;

export const descSDAgentDiagnostic = `404 from SD endpoints almost always means agent_identity or environment_id is wrong — both are required for AgentAccessCheck to resolve the agent. Both can be confirmed from the SD UI URL or via discovered_agent list.`;

// discovered_agent
export const descDiscoveredAgent = `Service Discovery agent — one SD deployment running inside a customer's Kubernetes cluster, bound to a single Harness environment. Its 'identity' field is the value other resources take as 'agent_identity' (discovered_namespace / discovered_service / discovered_network_map) and as 'agent_id' (chaos_service create/update). Soft-deleted agents are hidden from list results. The token field is never returned.`;

export const descListDiscoveredAgents = `List Service Discovery agents in the given account/org/project scope. Use this to look up the 'identity' value required by other Service Discovery resources and by chaos_service create/update. Optional environment_id narrows to one environment; omit to list agents across all environments in scope. Optional search does a case-insensitive regex match on the agent name. Supports page/limit pagination or all=true to fetch everything (all=true also skips per-agent installation/service/network-map count enrichment, so responses are lighter).`;

export const descDiscoveredAgentSearch = `Case-insensitive substring match against the SD agent name field.`;

// discovered_namespace
export const descDiscoveredNamespace = `Read-only snapshot of a Kubernetes Namespace recorded by a Service Discovery agent — includes the namespace name, UID, resource version, labels, annotations, owner references, and the full corev1.NamespaceSpec/Status from the cluster's last sync. Use namespaces as the scope boundary when listing discovered_service or future discovered_workload/discovered_connection resources for the same agent.`;

export const descListDiscoveredNamespaces = `List Kubernetes namespaces snapshotted by a Service Discovery agent. Requires agent_identity (path) and environment_id (query). Returns soft-deleted-aware results (only live namespaces). Optional name filter (exact match, NOT substring — see name field doc). Supports page/limit pagination or all=true to fetch everything.`;

export const descSDNamespaceNameFilter = `Filter namespaces by name — EXACT case-sensitive equality match against the Kubernetes namespace name (the SD backend wraps this in a Mongo equality filter, not a regex). For partial/fuzzy lookup, list all namespaces (use 'all=true') and filter client-side. Note: this differs from discovered_service's 'search' param, which IS case-insensitive substring.`;

// discovered_service
export const descDiscoveredService = `Read-only snapshot of a logical 'service' discovered by an SD agent. NOT limited to Kubernetes Services — the same resource type covers K8s Services / Workloads / Nodes, AWS load balancers (ALB/NLB/CLB), EC2 instances, Lambda functions, RDS, Linux/Windows VMs, Linux/Windows VM processes, and a generic 'Other' catch-all. The 'type' field discriminates which 'spec.*' block is populated. For Kubernetes services, 'spec.kubernetes' carries the K8s Service (cluster IPs, ports, type, external name) plus backing workloads (Deployment/StatefulSet/DaemonSet/Job/CronJob/RC) and pod replicas with phase, plus an optional cross-link to a Harness CD service.`;

export const descListDiscoveredServices = `List logical services discovered by an SD agent — covers Kubernetes Services/Workloads, AWS resources (ALB/NLB/CLB, EC2, Lambda, RDS), VMs, and VM processes. Requires agent_identity (path) and environment_id (query). Optional namespace filter applies an equality match on spec.kubernetes.namespace (useful for K8s-typed records). Optional search applies a case-insensitive regex on the service name. To inspect L4 network edges between services, use the future discovered_connection / discovered_service_connection resources.

IMPORTANT — pass compact: false on this call. The actionable payload lives inside spec.kubernetes.* (backing workloads with kind/uid, pod replicas with phase, service ports, cluster IPs, GKE NEG annotations) which the default compact mode strips because spec is not in the generic whitelist. The compacted view will silently drop these fields without indicating they exist.`;

export const descSDNamespaceFilter = `Filter discovered services by Kubernetes namespace (exact match on spec.kubernetes.namespace). Only meaningful for records with a Kubernetes-typed spec; non-K8s records (Lambda, EC2, VMs) won't match.`;

export const descSDSearchFilter = `Case-insensitive substring search on the discovered service's name field.`;

// discovered_network_map
export const descDiscoveredNetworkMap = `Service-discovery network map — the raw, per-agent inventory of services + connections discovered by an SD agent inside a single Kubernetes cluster.

This is step 3 of the chaos onboarding journey (see chaos_application_map for the full lifecycle):
  SD agent installed → discovers namespaces/services/workloads → user selects subset into an SD network map (this resource) → promoted into a chaos_application_map → experiments can target workloads inside it.

Use this resource to inspect what an SD agent has discovered BEFORE it is grouped/promoted into a chaos_application_map (e.g. to debug "why is my service missing from the application map?").

Returns name, identity, description, tags, environmentIdentifier, agentID, rules, resources (NetworkMapEntity[] — services in the map, each with kubernetes namespace + kind + hasWorkload metadata), and connections (eBPF-derived).`;

export const descListDiscoveredNetworkMaps = `List service-discovery network maps for a specific SD agent and environment.
Requires agent_identity (the SD agent ID, same as chaos_k8s_infrastructure.identity for SD-enabled infras) and environment_id.
Supports search (name substring) and the all toggle (default false → server returns paginated chunk; true → server returns full list and skips the user-name enrichment loop).`;

export const descSDNetworkMapSearch = `Case-insensitive substring match on network-map name. Optional.`;

export const descExperimentIdUUID = `Experiment UUID (v4). Optional for create — the server auto-generates a UUID when omitted; only pass an id if you need to control it explicitly. For update, pass the exact id from harness_get to avoid creating a duplicate.`;
