      description: "Security issue exemption/waiver. THIS is the resource for exemption approval/rejection workflows — even when the user mentions a vulnerability title like 'SQL Injection'. Supports list (POST with status filter), create, and approve/reject actions. Approval with body.scope='ACCOUNT', 'ORG', or 'PROJECT' routes through STO promotion internally. " +
        "CRITICAL SCOPE DISTINCTION: There are TWO different scope concepts that must NOT be confused: " +
        "(1) LISTING scope — security_exemption ALWAYS lists at project scope. NEVER pass resource_scope='account' or resource_scope='org' to harness_list. " +
        "When HARNESS_ORG / HARNESS_PROJECT defaults are unset (common in multi-user HTTP mode), pass org_id and project_id on every harness_list call — use the caller's current org/project when available. " +
        "(2) APPROVAL scope — the scope the exemption is approved AT, passed as body.scope to harness_execute. This CAN be 'ACCOUNT', 'ORG', 'PROJECT', or 'CURRENT'. " +
        "If harness_list returns an error about 'account scope not supported', that means you passed resource_scope='account' to the LIST call — NOT that account-level approval is impossible. Fix: remove resource_scope from the list call, keep project org_id/project_id, then approve with body={scope:'ACCOUNT'}. " +
        "Phrases like 'for org' or 'for account' refer to the APPROVAL SCOPE (body.scope on execute), NOT to resource_scope on list. " +
        "LIST FILTER: use filters.status (not exemption_statuses — that field belongs to security_issue). " +
        "PAGINATION CONTRACT: (1) Pass `size: 5` explicitly inside `filters` for the first call — the recommended default for this resource is 5, not the global 20. (2) Page is 0-indexed: page=0 → items 1–5, page=1 → items 6–10. (3) CRITICAL — `size` AND all other filters (status, search, …) MUST stay identical across every page in a session. The backend computes offset = page × size, so altering either silently shifts the dataset. (4) For 'next N' requests, increment `page` by 1 and keep `size` constant. If the user asks for 'next 10' after showing 5, make TWO sequential calls with the same size=5 — do NOT bump size mid-session. (5) After each response, read `_nextPageHint` — it spells out the exact follow-up call to make.",
