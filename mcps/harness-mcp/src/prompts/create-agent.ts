> **This is INTERACTIVE — show YAML for review and wait for confirmation before creating/updating the agent.**

---

## Phase 1: Check Existing Solutions First

**IMPORTANT: Before creating a new agent, check if an existing one can solve the use case.**

1. **List existing agents** — Call \`harness_list\` with \`resource_type="agent"\`${org_id ? ` and \`org_id="${org_id}"\`` : ""}${project_id ? ` and \`project_id="${project_id}"\`` : ""}
   - Check if any system or custom agents already exist that can handle this task
   - Ask user if they want to use/modify an existing agent instead of creating new

2. **For updating existing agents** — Use \`harness_get\` with \`resource_type="agent"\` and \`agent_id\` to retrieve the current agent configuration
   - Review the current \`spec\`, \`name\`, \`description\`, and other fields
   - **Detect the spec format before doing anything else** — this determines which path (Current Format or Legacy Format) the rest of Phase 2/3 must follow:
     - \`agent.uses\` present (e.g. \`uses: harnessAI@1.0.0\`) → **Current Format**
     - \`agent.step.group.steps\` present → **Legacy Format** — if detected, read the \`agent-docs:///legacy-format\` MCP resource in full **now**, before proceeding to Phase 2. It is self-contained (structure, spec-generation steps, and worked example) — reading it once here covers the rest of this workflow, so you should not need to re-read it at later phases.
     - **If you cannot read MCP resources, or the \`agent-docs:///legacy-format\` read fails/returns nothing: do not rewrite or modify the \`spec\` at all.** Do not guess the Legacy Format structure from memory, and do not fall back to Current Format. Stop, tell the user this client can't fetch the reference needed to safely edit a legacy-format agent's spec, and either proceed only with non-spec field updates (\`name\`, \`description\`, \`wiki\`) or ask them how they'd like to proceed.
   - Identify what needs to be changed (spec, name, description, wiki, logo)
   - Use \`harness_update\` (not \`harness_create\`) to update the agent with only the fields that need modification
   - **Never convert a Legacy Format agent to Current Format (or vice versa) during a routine update.** Keep editing in whatever format the agent already uses unless the user explicitly asks for a migration to the current format.

---

## Phase 2: Requirements Gathering

If creating a new agent or updating an existing one, collect the following before generating YAML.

**Format applies throughout Phase 2 §3–4 and Phase 3: creating a new agent always targets Current Format. Updating an existing agent targets whichever format Phase 1 detected for that agent — Current Format or Legacy Format.**

### 1. Agent Metadata
- **Name**: Display name for the agent (e.g. "Code Coverage Agent", "PR Reviewer")
- **Description**: Brief description of the agent's purpose (optional)
- **UID/UUID**: Always generate this from the name and pass it explicitly to create/update APIs. Do not rely on the create API fallback.
  - Generation rule: prefix with \`ca_\`, then lowercase the name, convert spaces and hyphens (\`-\`) to \`_\`, replace any remaining non-alphanumeric runs with \`_\`, collapse duplicate \`_\`, and trim leading/trailing \`_\` from the slug portion (e.g. "Code Coverage Agent" → \`ca_code_coverage_agent\`, "PR Reviewer" → \`ca_pr_reviewer\`)
  - If the generated UID conflicts with an existing agent, ask the user whether to reuse/update that agent or append a short suffix

### 2. Task Details

**This is an INTERACTIVE requirements gathering process. Ask clarifying questions and verify understanding with the user before proceeding.**

Ask and clarify the following with the user:

1. **Agent's exact goal**: What specific outcome should the agent achieve? Be specific — avoid vague goals.

2. **Inputs the agent needs**: Repository info? Execution context? Configuration? Secrets?

3. **Outputs the agent produces**: Files? External actions? Data/metrics?

4. **What the agent works on**: Specific file paths? External services? Databases/APIs?

5. **Task workflow**: Step-by-step workflow (do 1, then 2, then 3, etc.)

6. **Constraints and preferences**: Limitations, rules, or coding standards (e.g., "Use idiomatic Go code", "Do not modify existing tests")

7. **Definition of done**: How do you know the agent succeeded? Specific criteria, artifacts, or exit conditions.

### 3. Recommend Configuration

Based on requirements, recommend and verify with the user:

1. **Task instructions**:
   - Break down the goal into detailed step-by-step instructions
   - Include specific commands, file paths, and expected outcomes
   - **Current Format**: put instructions in \`with.prompt\`; reference custom inputs using \`<+inputs.fieldName>\` syntax
   - **Legacy Format**: put instructions in \`PLUGIN_TASK\` env var; reference inputs using \`\${{inputs.fieldName}}\` syntax
   - Add \`## RULES\` section at the end with constraints formatted as markdown bullet points (same convention in both formats)

2. **Runtime inputs** (custom \`inputs\` declared on the agent, beyond what the base template/legacy structure already provides):
   - Only add if user confirms runtime parameters are needed (repo, branch, executionId, thresholds, etc.)
   - **Always set a \`default\` value for every non-required input** — if it's referenced (\`<+inputs.x>\` in Current Format, \`\${{inputs.x}}\` in Legacy Format) and no value is supplied at runtime nor a default exists, the agent will error at execution time
   - **Current Format**: always confirm \`allowed_domains\` (comma-separated hosts/wildcards/regexes; default \`"harness.io"\`) so users understand and control non-LLM/non-MCP network access
   - **Legacy Format**: always confirm \`allowedDomains\` (regex patterns separated by \`|\`; default \`""\`)

3. **Connectors**:
   - LLM connector for model access (required for all agents) - User must create via Harness UI or MCP
   - MCP connectors for external services (GitHub, Slack, Harness platform, etc.) - only if needed
   - All authentication and secrets are managed within the connectors
   - **If the user wants to pin a specific model** (Current Format only): ask which provider the LLM connector uses (Anthropic, OpenAI, Copilot, etc.) — the model-override env var key depends on it and cannot be inferred from a placeholder connector ID. See "Model override" below.

**Present this recommended configuration to the user and iterate until confirmed.**

### 4. Default Configuration & Inputs

**Use Current Format for every new agent, and for updates to an agent Phase 1 detected as Current Format. Use Legacy Format only when updating an agent Phase 1 detected as Legacy Format (see \`agent-docs:///legacy-format\`, already read in Phase 1).**

**Agent structure (Current Format):** the spec instantiates the shared \`harnessAI@1.0.0\` base template via \`uses:\` / \`with:\`. It does **not** redeclare a container, step, or layout — those live on the base template itself.

**Default structure:**
\`\`\`yaml
agent:
  uses: harnessAI@1.0.0
  with:
    prompt: |
      <step-by-step task instructions>
    connector: your_llm_connector_id
\`\`\`

**Core \`with:\` fields (always present):**
\`\`\`yaml
with:
  prompt: |                              # Task instructions, multiline string, ends with a ## RULES section
    <step-by-step instructions>
  connector: your_llm_connector_id       # LLM connector ref — user must replace with actual connector ID
\`\`\`

**Commonly added \`with:\` fields (include only if the use case needs them):**
\`\`\`yaml
with:
  mcp:                                             # Only if external services (GitHub, Slack, etc.) are needed
    - your_mcp_connector_id                        # User must replace
  allowed_domains: "github.com,api.github.com"     # Comma-separated hosts/wildcards/regexes; default "harness.io"
  max_turns: "150"                                 # Adjust based on task complexity; default "150"
\`\`\`

**Model override (only if user explicitly requests a specific model):** the env var key depends on the connector's underlying provider — this cannot be inferred from a placeholder connector ID, so ask the user which provider their connector uses:

| Connector provider | env var key |
|---|---|
| Anthropic | \`ANTHROPIC_MODEL\` |
| OpenAI | \`OPENAI_MODEL\` |
| Copilot | \`MODEL\` |
| Anything else, or unsure | **Ask the user to confirm the correct key — do not guess** |

\`\`\`yaml
with:
  env:
    ANTHROPIC_MODEL: your-model-name     # Example for an Anthropic connector; swap the key per the table above
\`\`\`

This mapping may collapse to a single generic \`MODEL\` key across all connectors in a future platform update — if the user's environment has already migrated, confirm with them before assuming this table still applies.

**Advanced \`with:\` fields (ask before adding — only if the use case calls for them; do not include any of these by default):**
- \`docker_connector\` — custom image/registry connector, only if needed (default \`account.harnessImage\`)
- \`image\` — non-default runner image, only if needed (default \`harness/harness-ai-agent:latest\`)
- \`skill\` — path to a \`SKILL.md\` to install before the run
- \`allowed_tools\` — comma-separated tool allowlist (empty = default allowlist)
- \`output\` — path to a file the agent must produce; verified after the run
- \`workdir\` — working directory (default \`/harness\`, the CI workspace)
- \`backend\` — \`claude | deepagent | openai | codex | copilot\` (empty = runner default)

**Custom inputs (only if the use case needs runtime parameters beyond the fields above):**
\`\`\`yaml
agent:
  uses: harnessAI@1.0.0
  with:
    prompt: |
      Review the pull request for repository <+inputs.repo_name> on branch <+inputs.branch>.
    connector: your_llm_connector_id
  inputs:
    repo_name:
      type: string
      default: my-org/my-repo
    branch:
      type: string
      default: main
\`\`\`
- Declare custom inputs under \`agent.inputs\` (same \`type\` / \`default\` / \`ui\` shape as before)
- Reference them inside any \`with:\` value using \`<+inputs.fieldName>\` — **not** \`\${{inputs.fieldName}}\` (that syntax is Legacy Format only)
- There is **no** per-agent \`layout\` block in Current Format — layout is owned entirely by the \`harnessAI\` base template

**Network access:** \`allowed_domains\` controls additional non-LLM/non-MCP network access. Current Format accepts comma-separated exact hosts, \`*.\` wildcards, or regexes — this replaces the old pipe-\`|\`-separated regex-only convention.

**Supported input types:** \`string\`, \`secret\`, \`boolean\`, \`connector\`, \`array\`

**IMPORTANT:** Users must create connectors via Harness UI or \`harness_create\` with \`resource_type="connector"\` before running the agent.

---

## Phase 3: Generate Agent Spec

Assemble the complete agent YAML specification (\`spec\` field). **Use Current Format when creating a new agent, or updating an agent Phase 1 detected as Current Format. Use Legacy Format only when updating an agent Phase 1 detected as Legacy Format (\`agent-docs:///legacy-format\`).**

1. Start directly with \`agent:\` — there is no top-level \`version:\` key in the spec itself
2. Add \`agent.uses: harnessAI@1.0.0\`
3. Add \`agent.with\` section (all task config lives here):
   - \`prompt:\` — multiline string with step-by-step instructions and \`## RULES\` section
   - \`connector: your_llm_connector_id\` (always required)
   - \`mcp:\` (only if MCPs needed) — array of MCP connector refs
   - \`allowed_domains:\` (only if the use case needs extra network access) — comma-separated hosts/wildcards/regexes
   - \`max_turns:\` (only if a non-default turn budget is needed) — string, default \`"150"\`
   - \`env.<PROVIDER>_MODEL\` or \`env.MODEL\` (**only** if user explicitly requests a specific model) — pick the key from the "Model override" table in Phase 2 §4 based on the connector's provider; ask the user if the provider isn't clear, never guess
   - Advanced fields (\`docker_connector\`, \`image\`, \`skill\`, \`allowed_tools\`, \`output\`, \`workdir\`, \`backend\`) — **only** if the use case calls for them
4. Add \`agent.inputs\` section **only** for custom, agent-specific runtime parameters not covered by \`with:\` fields above (e.g. \`repo_name\`, \`branch\`) — reference them from \`with:\` values using \`<+inputs.fieldName>\`
5. Do **not** add an \`agent.layout\` block — layout is owned by the \`harnessAI\` base template, not the per-agent spec

**Always notify users to create connectors and replace placeholder IDs before running the agent.**

---

## Phase 4: Present for Review

Present the complete agent configuration to the user:
- Agent metadata (name, description, uid)
- Full spec YAML
- Required connectors

**Wait for explicit confirmation before creating/updating the agent.**

---

## Phase 5: Create or Update Agent

Only after confirmation, use \`harness_create\` to create a new agent or \`harness_update\` to update an existing one:

### Creating a New Agent

\`\`\`
Call MCP tool: harness_create
Parameters:
  resource_type: "agent"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
  body: {
    uid: "<generated_from_agent_name>",
    name: "<Agent Display Name>",
    description: "<Brief description of agent purpose>",
    spec: "<agent YAML spec as a string>",
    wiki: "<optional: markdown documentation>"
  }
\`\`\`

**Key fields for creation:**
- \`uid\` (required): Unique identifier. Always generate from \`name\` as \`ca_<slug>\` and send explicitly (e.g. "Code Coverage Agent" → \`ca_code_coverage_agent\`). Do not omit it or rely on API-side auto-generation.
- \`name\` (required): Display name for the agent
- \`description\` (optional): Brief description
- \`spec\` (required): The full agent YAML specification as a string. New agents always use Current Format (\`agent:\`, \`agent.uses: harnessAI@1.0.0\`, \`agent.with\`, optional \`agent.inputs\` — see Phase 3)
- \`wiki\` (optional): Markdown documentation for the agent

### Updating an Existing Agent

\`\`\`
Call MCP tool: harness_update
Parameters:
  resource_type: "agent"
  resource_id: "<agent_identifier>"
  org_id: "<organization>"
  project_id: "<project>"
  body: {
    name: "<Updated Display Name>",           # optional
    description: "<Updated description>",     # optional
    spec: "<updated agent YAML spec>",        # optional
    wiki: "<updated markdown docs>"           # optional
  }
\`\`\`

**Key notes for updates:**
- All fields in the body are optional — only provide fields you want to update
- Only custom agents (role='custom') can be updated; system agents cannot be modified
- The \`spec\` field replaces the entire agent specification when provided
- Use \`harness_get\` first to retrieve the current agent configuration before updating, and detect its format (Current vs Legacy — see Phase 1) before generating the updated \`spec\`
- The updated \`spec\` must stay in the **same format** the agent already uses (Current Format in, Current Format out; Legacy Format in, Legacy Format out) unless the user explicitly asked for a migration

---

## Example: Code Review Agent (Current Format)

Use this example for all new agents, and for updates to any agent already on Current Format.

\`\`\`yaml
agent:
  uses: harnessAI@1.0.0
  with:
    prompt: |
      Review the pull request for repository <+inputs.repo_name> on branch <+inputs.branch>.

      1. Analyze code changes for security vulnerabilities
      2. Check for code quality issues
      3. Verify test coverage
      4. Post review comments using GitHub MCP tools

      ## RULES
      - Focus on critical security issues first
      - Be constructive in feedback
      - Suggest specific code improvements
    connector: your_llm_connector_id  # User must replace with actual connector ID
    allowed_domains: "github.com,api.github.com"
    max_turns: "150"
    mcp:
      - your_github_mcp_connector  # User must replace with actual connector ID
  inputs:
    repo_name:
      type: string
      default: my-org/my-repo

    branch:
      type: string
      default: main
\`\`\`

Notes:
- \`max_turns\` is shown here for reference — omit it when the default (\`"150"\`) is fine
- A model-override \`env\` entry is deliberately **not** shown here — only add one (see the "Model override" table above) when the user explicitly requests a pinned model, using the key that matches the connector's provider (\`ANTHROPIC_MODEL\`, \`OPENAI_MODEL\`, \`MODEL\`, etc.). Never default to \`ANTHROPIC_MODEL\` regardless of connector.
- \`repo_name\` and \`branch\` are custom inputs, referenced from \`with.prompt\` via \`<+inputs.fieldName>\`
- No \`version:\`, \`layout:\`, or \`step:\` blocks — those either don't exist in Current Format or are owned by the \`harnessAI\` base template

For a worked example in Legacy Format (only for updating agents already on this format), read the "Worked Example: Code Review Agent" section of the \`agent-docs:///legacy-format\` resource (already read in Phase 1 if detected).

---

## CRITICAL GUIDELINES

**These are essential rules you MUST follow when creating/updating agents:**

| Guideline                  | Rule                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Check existing first**   | Always call \`harness_list(resource_type="agent")\` to see if an existing agent can solve the use case before creating new                                                     |
| **Format detection**       | Before updating, detect the existing agent's format (\`agent.uses\` = Current, \`agent.step.group.steps\` = Legacy) and keep the update in that **same** format — never silently migrate. New agents always start in Current Format. Read \`agent-docs:///legacy-format\` in full when Legacy Format is detected. |
| **Updating agents**        | Use \`harness_get\` to retrieve current config, then \`harness_update\` (not \`harness_create\`) to modify. Only custom agents can be updated.                                     |
| **Generate UID**           | Always derive \`uid\` as \`ca_<slug>\` (e.g. "Code Coverage Agent" → \`ca_code_coverage_agent\`) — matches platform UI \`nameToUid()\`. Pass it explicitly; do not rely on create API fallback. |
| **Agent spec format (Current)** | The \`spec\` field instantiates \`agent.uses: harnessAI@1.0.0\` with an \`agent.with\` block. There is no \`step\`, \`container\`, or \`layout\` in the per-agent spec — those live on the base template. |
| **Task location**          | Current Format: task instructions go in \`with.prompt\` (multiline string), turn budget in \`with.max_turns\`. Legacy Format: task instructions go in \`PLUGIN_TASK\` env var, turn budget in \`PLUGIN_MAX_TURNS\`. |
| **Expression syntax**      | Use \`<+inputs.fieldName>\` in Current Format and \`\${{inputs.fieldName}}\` in Legacy Format — never mix the two; the wrong syntax silently fails to resolve at runtime. |
| **Model override is optional & provider-dependent** | Do NOT add a model-override env var by default. When the user explicitly requests one: Current Format uses \`with.env.<PROVIDER>_MODEL\` where the key depends on the connector's provider (Anthropic → \`ANTHROPIC_MODEL\`, OpenAI → \`OPENAI_MODEL\`, Copilot → \`MODEL\`; ask if unsure, never guess). Legacy Format uses a \`modelName\` input plus a fixed \`ANTHROPIC_MODEL\` env var. |
| **Allowed domains**       | Current Format: \`with.allowed_domains\` is comma-separated hosts/wildcards/regexes, default \`"harness.io"\`. Legacy Format: \`allowedDomains\` input is \`|\`-separated regexes, default \`""\`. Confirm the right convention for the detected format before writing it. |
| **Input defaults**         | Every non-required input that is referenced (\`<+inputs.x>\` in Current Format, \`\${{inputs.x}}\` in Legacy Format) **must have a \`default\` value** — omitting it causes a runtime error if the caller does not supply the value  |
| **Connector placeholders** | Always use placeholders like \`your_llm_connector_id\` and \`your_mcp_connector_id\` and notify users to replace both LLM and MCP connector IDs with actual values before running the agent |
| **No clone/platform**      | Do NOT add \`clone\`, \`platform\`, \`os\`, or \`arch\` sections — agents are standalone with a simplified structure. (\`allowed_tools\` is a legitimate Current Format \`with:\` field — this rule does not apply to it.) |
| **Quality first**          | Agent quality is paramount — verify YAML structure, validate all references, ensure complete task instructions before creating                                                |`
        }
      }]
    })
  );
}
